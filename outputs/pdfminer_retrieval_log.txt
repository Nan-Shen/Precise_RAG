NVIDIA  is  now  a  full-stack\ncomputing infrastructure company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.\n\nOur  full-stack  includes  the  foundational  CUDA  programming  model  that  runs  on  all  NVIDIA  GPUs,  as  well  as  hundreds  of  domain-\nspeciﬁc software libraries, software development kits, or SDKs, and Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs. This deep and broad\nsoftware stack accelerates the performance and eases the deployment of NVIDIA accelerated computing for computationally intensive\nworkloads such as artiﬁcial intelligence, or AI, model training and inference, data analytics, scientiﬁc computing, and 3D graphics, with\nvertical-speciﬁc optimizations to address industries ranging from healthcare and telecom to automotive and manufacturing.\n\nOur  data-center-scale  offerings  are  comprised  of  compute  and  networking  solutions  that  can  scale  to  tens  of  thousands  of  GPU-\naccelerated servers interconnected to function as a single giant computer; this type of data center architecture and scale is needed for\nthe development and deployment of modern AI applications.\n\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and ﬁlms. Today, it also simulates\nhuman intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands\nof  computing  cores,  are  essential  for  deep  learning  algorithms.  This  form  of AI,  in  which  software  writes  itself  by  learning  from  large\namounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots, and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-\npowered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been immensely\ndifﬁcult  or  even  impossible  with  traditional  coding.',)

We  engage  with  independent  subcontractors  and  contract  manufacturers  such  as  Hon  Hai\nPrecision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our ﬁnal products.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and\npartners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing,\nand total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features\nand  functions  that  customers  and  partners  will  demand  and  whether  we  are  able  to  deliver  consistent  volumes  of  our  products  at\nacceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market\nentrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our\nproducts.  In  addition,  it  is  possible  that  new  competitors  or  alliances  among  competitors  could  emerge  and  acquire  signiﬁcant  market\nshare.',)

The strong year-on-year growth was driven by demand for our\nHopper  architecture  accelerated  computing  platform  used  for  large  language  models,  recommendation  engines,  and  generative  AI\napplications. We began shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of ﬁscal year 2025.\n\nGaming revenue for ﬁscal year 2025 was up 9% from a year ago, driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\n\nProfessional  Visualization  revenue  for  ﬁscal  year  2025  was  up  21%  from  a  year  ago,  driven  by  the  continued  ramp  of Ada  RTX  GPU\nworkstations for use cases such as generative AI-powered design, simulation, and engineering.\n\nAutomotive revenue for ﬁscal year 2025 was up 55% from a year ago, driven by sales of our self-driving platforms.\n\nGross margin increased in ﬁscal year 2025 driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.\n\nOperating expenses for ﬁscal year 2025 were up 45% from a year ago, driven by higher compensation and beneﬁts expenses due to\nemployee  growth  and  compensation  increases,  and  engineering  development,  compute  and  infrastructure  costs  for  new  product\nintroductions.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nOur consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or\nU.S. GAAP. The preparation of these ﬁnancial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts\nof assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those\nestimates that involve a signiﬁcant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our ﬁnancial condition or results of\noperations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, income taxes, and revenue recognition.',)
